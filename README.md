# IPM-Particle-Tracking-Code
Chris's Particle Tracking Code for ISIS Ionisation Profile Monitors

This repository has been created to store copies of my particle tracking code for ISIS IPMs, which I am re-writing in python.

This allows the previous three seperate codes to be written as one single code, increases the simulation speed, and will be a more user freidnly and flexible version of the code so that it can be used on other monitors, such as IPMs for a new FFA accelerator.
